EthosAI Automated Ethics Report — 2025-11-06 18:49 UTC\n\nExecutive summary:\nEthosAI detected measurable gender disparity in the baseline model and applied reweighing mitigation. The mitigation adjusted group TPRs with a small accuracy trade-off (0.8529 → 0.8480).\n\nRoot-cause hypotheses:\n- Model uses socio-economic features (e.g., education and capital gains) which correlate with both income and demographic groups, producing observed disparities.\n- Presence of 'sex' as an important feature indicates the model learns direct gender signals which amplify disparities.\n\nNext steps (recommended):\n1. Evaluate reweighing + thresholding combined and measure TPR/FPR parity and accuracy on a held-out set.\n2. Consider data augmentation for under-represented groups (synthetic examples) and validate on factuality/utility.\n3. Add human-in-the-loop review for high-impact decisions and produce model cards for compliance.
